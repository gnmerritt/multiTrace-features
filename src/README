multiTRACE with Features

Author: Nathan Merritt
Date: January, 2011

Overview:

The aim of this project is to develop a multiple layer cell-assembly network
that is capable of general pattern recognition. Initial testing will begin
with highly controlled, static input patterns. Once the network has been
configured and is capable of producing the results Sonntag (1991) obtained
in his dissertation, the networks input layer will be reworked to process
the results of a SIFT/SURF feature detection algorithm. The key points from
the vision algorithm will be fed into the network, and hopefully allow it
to recognize objects in a cognitively inspired manner. 

This directory contains the implementation of the multiTRACE network. test/
contains the unit tests that were used during development. 

Usage:

Build is managed by Eclipse, will produce 'multiTrace vision' binary that 
contains the unit tests
